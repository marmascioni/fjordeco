FjordEco Ecosystem Modeling Course
------------------------------------------

This section of the summer course will focus on numerical modeling of ecosystems in the Antarctic Fjord. We will learn the basic techniques...


1. Download and install miniconda for your respective platform from:

https://conda.io/miniconda.html

2. Once installed, copy the `environment.yml` file to your local machine.

3. Create a new `conda` environment with:

`% conda env create --file environment.yml`

This will create a new conda environment with `python` and `R` installed and ready to use the notebooks provided in the lab session.

4. Once it is installed, select your new `conda` environment via:

`% conda activate fjordeco`

5. Then, start the Jupyter Lab:

`% jupyter lab`

6. This should start your web browser with a Jupyter Lab session ready. Download the notebooks to your machine, and you can open and run them locally on your machine.
